[問題](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/)

Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## 解答の方針

`strings.Index()`を使えば一発じゃない?

## 実装
```go
func numOfStrings(patterns []string, word string) int {
  count := 0
  for _, v := range patterns {
    if strings.Index(word, v) != -1 {
      count++
    }
  }
  return count
}
```
